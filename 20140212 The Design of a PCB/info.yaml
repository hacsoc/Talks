  The design of a PCB (printed circuit board).
  Objective planning and reading datasheets.
  Schematic capture: understanding how the parts connect, expressing.
  Electrical requirements/values.
  Layout: footprint design, number of layers on board, routing signals,
  ground/power planes, design rules/constraints, placement of components
  Manufacturing options for prototypes.
  Software options and standards for this process.
  Board hand assembly: surface mount and through-hole.
  Demonstrations of gEDA and the resulting product.
