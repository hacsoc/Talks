description: >
  The design of a PCB (printed circuit board).
  Objective planning and reading datasheets.
  Schematic capture: understanding how the parts connect, expressing electrical requirements/values.
  Layout: footprint design, number of layers on board, routing signals, ground/power planes, design rules/constraints, placement of components.
  Manufacturing options for prototypes.
  Board hand assembly: surface mount and through-hole.
  Software options and standards for this process.
  Demonstrations of gEDA and the resulting product.
