  This week Ryan Welton, a CWRU alum at Mobile defense is giving a talk titled
  "Introduction to Android Reversing".  They describe the talk as, "a brief
  overview of the Android architecture, take a dive into the Dalvik VM, explain
  Dalvik Bytecode". In addition he will patch an application to remove or do
  something unexpected.  

  Mobile Defense is a local company that is held in high regard by a number of
  students I've spoken to here.  They work on some pretty cool stuff and seem to
  be winning awards like there's no tomorrow.
