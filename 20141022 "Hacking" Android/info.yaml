  Matt Insko (San Diego State University '99) of PreEmptive Solutions will be
  talking about the tools used to hack Android. This is a great talk to go to
  if you're attending Kent Hack Enough. While you won't be able to do anything
  of this scale in a weekend, the talk should introduce you to some tools that
  may be of use to you later. Matt is a professional Java developer and
  currently works on byte code obfuscation, so we're sure all of our hackers
  can learn a thing or two from him. We'll see you there.
