  Every want to multiply big ass matrices? If you want to do image/video processing,
  or computer vision then the answer is yes. OpenCL is an open, cross platform,
  GPU compute library that allows you to use your GPU to do things like multiply
  big ass matrices.

  MIM is a Cleveland based medical imaging company; they have really cool software
  that takes 3d scans and rescales them and uses feature matching to overlay them
  in another color so you can, lets say, take 2 CT scans from different points in
  time and see how the size and shape of a tumor is changing overtime.
