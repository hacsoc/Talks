  This week we were going to have the very smart John Gunderman give a talk on
  Haskell.  However, it seems like he has tickets to go see Aziz Ansari or
  something else far less cool than HacSoc. 
  <br />
  In light of this, you're all stuck hearing me talk about random number generators.
  It's the talk I'm giving to my crypto class that morning, but hopefully it
  should be able to be morphed into something acceptable for you all.
