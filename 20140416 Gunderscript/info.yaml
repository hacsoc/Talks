  Christian Gunderman, a sophomore at Case is going to be talking about
  a scripting language he is making called gunderscript. Gunderscript features
  a compiler that compiles it to a byte-code that is executed in a stack based
  virtual machine. Christian will be talking about the architecture of his
  compiler and virtual machine and will of course have a demo of his language.
