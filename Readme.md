The CWRU Hacker Society is a forum for technical talks on the Case Western Reserve campus.

Notes and other materials from our talks are stored here.

Add submodules using the `git://github.com/hacsoc/repo.git` format rather than the `git@github.com` format.

Check out `gh-pages` and run `deploy.sh` to regenerate and deploy the static site.
