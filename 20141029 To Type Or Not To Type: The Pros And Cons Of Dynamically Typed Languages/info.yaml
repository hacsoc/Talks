  Due to a last-minute speaker cancellation, CWRU senior Brendan Higgins will
  be stepping up to the plate for us. Brendan has a history of giving really
  solid talks, so you won't want to miss this. If so far you've only tinkered
  with Java, you might be surprised to learn that some languages don't make you
  explicitly declare the "type" of something. Like anything in Computer
  Science, it's a trade-off, and there's a lot of debate about whether it's
  worth it. Brendan will use this talk to teach what this means and explain the
  arguments both for and against this kind of typing. It'll be a good time, so
  we'll see you tomorrow night.
