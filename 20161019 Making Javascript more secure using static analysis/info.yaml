  Static Analysis is a great tool for learning more about the code we write. 
  Particularly, its application in bug-finding and vulnerability detection is 
  really cool and really useful. This talk will be a theoretical introduction 
  to Static Analysis, with my work on Javascript as a motivating example, and 
  vulnerability detection as the end-goal.
