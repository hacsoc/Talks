  Jon Pfeil and Steph Hippo will be co-hosting a talk about Version Control and
  git. Drop/Add deadline is on Friday, and understanding git may be essential
  to getting through your classes. We'll teach you what it is, how to use it,
  and get you making your first commits by the end of the night. This is an
  interactive talk, so bring your laptop with git already installed. If you
  have trouble with the install, shoot Steph an email (before Wednesday) to
  schedule a time to help you out.
