  Tom and Brian don't talk about some monk who did stuff with numbers. Instead
  they'll wax poetic about the fun parts of web development.  Come to the talk
  to hear about the new hotness in html5, css3, and javascript.  
  <br />
  Each topic will be covered with an easy introduction to how things currently
  work, a demonstration of something annoying about the current process, and then
  move into how these new web technologies solve all the worlds problems, and let
  you eat your cake too.
