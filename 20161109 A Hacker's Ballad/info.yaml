  Hacking goes deeper than the dictionary definition. It isn't about stealing 
  confidential documents or defacing websites; it√çs about manipulating systems 
  to fit your needs. In the first half of this talk, Ben will be discussing the 
  workshops and debauchery that occur during DEFCON, the largest gathering of 
  security researchers, feds, social engineers, cyberpunks, and basement 
  dwellers in the world, and why you should go to Las Vegas next summer. In the 
  second half, Ben will perform a deep dive into the world of network 
  monitoring, how to use Burp Suite and Wireshark to do detailed web traffic 
  analysis, and how to use that information to help you get a fresh pair of 
  Yeezy Boost 350s without having to worry about them selling out.
