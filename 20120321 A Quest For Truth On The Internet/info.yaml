  This talk will first delve into the importance of empirical Internet
  measurement as a means for understanding the system at scale.  We will
  discuss the history of rigorous measurement and the general approaches
  taken to date.  We argue that the approaches taken to date---while
  useful in modest terms---lack the broad visibility required to
  understand the Internet at scale.  We then introduce a Firefox
  extension---called Fathom---that will provides a measurement-oriented
  API to JavaScript code that can be included with any web page and hence
  executed on a broad set of Internet-connected hosts.  We discuss several
  use cases for this extensions, discuss security and privacy
  implications, sketch the overhead of the system and the accuracy of the
  measurements.
