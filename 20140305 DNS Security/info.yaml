  The Domain Name System (DNS) is a critical component of the Internet infrastructure
  as it maps human-readable names to IP addresses.  Injecting fraudulent mappings
  allows an attacker to divert users from intended destinations to those of an
  attacker's choosing.  In this talk, we show the results of a measurement study
  of the Internet's vulnerability to DNS record injection attacks - including a
  new attack we uncover.  We find that record injection vulnerabilities are fairly
  common - even years after some of them were first uncovered.
