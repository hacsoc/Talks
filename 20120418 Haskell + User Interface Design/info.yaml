  John Gunderman will talk about Haskell and Tim Bruckner will talk about user
  interface design magic.  If I'm in a good mood, one of them will talk first
  and the other one second.  If I'm upset, the talks will occur simultaneously
  in a "whoever shouts louder wins" format.  I strongly recommend that both of
  the speakers keep me happy tomorrow. Honestly, both talks should be pretty
  interesting, and appeal to a wide range of people.
