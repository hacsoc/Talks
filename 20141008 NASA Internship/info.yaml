  Hear from one of Hacker Society's own when Luc Bettaieb talks about his
  experience interning at NASA, what the current state of our space agency is,
  and why people should still care.  He'll be talking about the program he did
  on his first summer working at MSFC, the Robotics Academy as well as other
  summer work and how it's relevant to space exploration. Hear about what NASA
  is doing now and how its relevant to the future of space exploration. You can
  impact space exploration without actually being an astronaut, before you even
  graduate.
