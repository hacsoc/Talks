  Multihomed devices on the internet have been plentiful since the rise of 
  smartphones, but techniques to take advantage of multiple network paths 
  without writing custom applications are still in development. One solution, 
  MultiPath TCP, enables TCP communication over multiple network paths for any 
  program (including legacy TCP-based programs) running on a host. Matt will 
  explain the advantages of this solution and cover the basics of MultiPath TCP 
  connection establishment and management. Matt will also provide information 
  on how to replace a vanilla TCP stack with a MultiPath TCP capable stack 
  under Linux.
