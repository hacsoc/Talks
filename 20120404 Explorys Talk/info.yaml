  Explorys is the company that has been sponsoring those Hadoop user groups
  down at CSU that a few of us have gone to.  Those have been really great, so
  come to HacSoc on Wednesday to get a taste of it right here on our campus.
  If you're interested in startups in the Cleveland area, Explorys is just about
  as good as it gets.  See you there!
