  TEMPEST and SIGINT (Signals Intelligence) -- Or: The Tip of the Iceberg in Ubiquitous Electronic Signals
  <br />
  We live in a highly interconnected world, yet many of those interconnections
  are either passively or actively hidden from us. Furthermore, many of the analysis
  tools are expensive, confusing, or are simply never taught. My talk will both
  introduce the concept of TEMPEST as well as more broadly describe signals
  intelligence attacks, counterattacks, and counter-countermeasures, as well as an
  overview of time vs. frequency domain analysis, vulnerability of devices, and
  a variety of demonstrations exposing these concepts (and a couple of campus radio
  signals to boot). Topics covered will include:
  <br />
  -So what's a spectrum analyzer, anyways?
  <br />
  -Why are all* receivers transmitters?
  <br />
  -What do power supplies have to do with device security?
  <br />
  -What kinds of radio protocols are out there?
  <br />
  -What kinds of equipment can be used to toy around with these concepts?
  <br />
  ...as well as a variety of other concepts.
