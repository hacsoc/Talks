  I will talk about how to pull relevant information off of web pages using tools
  such as Nokogiri and Mechanize, and some tips for how to best analyze the source
  code to most efficiently extract the information. I will also go over how search
  engines like Google create web crawlers that scrape information off of web pages
  to create an index of the internet.
