  Ruby is a truly complete object oriented language in the sense that everything
  in Ruby is an object. Ruby also allows you to modify any preexisting type.
  For example, let's say you wish that integers defined some method, you can
  just add that method in on your own! There are some other languages that allow
  you to do similar things so it is always useful (and fun) to see how others do it.
