  On August 6th this year, approximately 800,000 square feet of Case's campus 
  experienced an electrical outage for ten hours -- intentionally. It was a
  culmination of over a year of study and planning regarding how to make part 
  of Case's electrical infrastructure more robust and reliable for many years 
  to come, and a fantastic victory against the entropic forces of time. In this 
  talk, Tyler will discuss the history of this segment of Case's power 
  distribution system (starting in the 1920s) and the equipment involved, 
  explore the issues desiring improvement, and describe the day of the outage 
  and some of the challenges encountered (and how they were overcome). In 
  addition to this, Tyler will share photographs and video of some of the 
  equipment involved. Tyler hope to both depict the considerable complexity 
  behind our everyday activities on campus as well as perhaps spark interest in 
  a side of electrical engineering not commonly encountered in studies here at 
  Case.
