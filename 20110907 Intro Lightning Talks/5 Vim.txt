VIM: THE LIGHTNING TALK
=======================

Why, oh WHY, do those #?@! nutheads use vi?
http://www.viemu.com/a-why-vi-vim.html

This document is on Github!
https://github.com/irskep/intro_talks_2011

My reasons:

* Remote editing
* Handwriting : touch typing :: Notepad : vim
* Tried emacs and didn't like it (ymmv)
* Editing text takes less effort than any other editor I have used
* Shortens the distance between your brain planning an edit and it actually happening
  (try telling a professional Starcraft player to give up macros)
* The philosophy is cool!














The philosophy you say?
-----------------------

Inserting text is pretty cool, but most of what we do is *moving* and *replacing* text.
So vim has 3 modes, 2 of which are important:

* Insert mode for inserting text AND ONLY INSERTING TEXT
* Normal mode for manipulating text and moving the cursor for insert mode
* Visual mode, mostly to make the GUI ports (e.g. MacVim) work nicely with the mouse

Normal mode commands are verbs, nouns, or "other."

Examples of verbs:

* Insert (i)
* Delete (d)
* Change (c)
* Append (a)
* Toggle case (~)
* Open a new line below the current one (o)
* Yank (copy) and paste (y, p)
* Move by one character (hjkl or arrow keys)

Examples of nouns:

* beginning, end of word, line, sentence, paragraph
* beginning, end of the document
* next or previous occurrence of a character
* next or previous occurrence of a regular expression

Examples of "other":

* Start/stop recording macro (q), play macro (@)
* Undo (u), redo (ctrl-r)
* Repeat (.)














Vim for the supremely lazy (i.e. EECS 337 students)
---------------------------------------------------

    > vim myfile.txt

    - i
    - I am editing a file
    - <esc>
    - :w

    > cat myfile.txt
    I am editing a file














Baby's first changes
--------------------

Using: ixwbc

    vma sucks!

* Fix vma -> vim by inserting 'i' and deleting 'a'
* Replace sucks -> rocks using cw

wbchjkl probably account for 70% of my normal mode keystrokes.














Deleting stuff
--------------

Using: dpPu

There is word a out of place.

* move to 'word' and delete it with dw
* move to 'a' and paste with p
* oh no it pasted in the wrong place, undo with 'u' 
* move to the space after 'a'
* paste again


These lines
of order
are out

* move to 'of order'
* delete line with dd
* paste after current line with p


These lines
of order
are out

* another way: move to 'are out'
* delete line with dd
* paste before current line with P













More fun things
---------------

Using: aA0^$CI

    Finish this sentence with a

* move to the end of the line with $
* try to add with i, lol you can't
* use a instead, it means append
* undo that, let's do it a better way
* move to the start of the line with 0 or ^ (^ moves past leading whitespace)
* append to the entire line with A














Let's get crazy now
-------------------

Using: q

    zonk('alice', 123)
        zonk('bob', 456),
    junk
    x, zonk('carol', 789)

The zonk function maintainer just flipped his function arguments. WHAAAAT

okay don't panic we can solve this with MACROS

* use /zonk<return> to find an occurrence of zonk
* press q to start recording a macro
* use f' to go to the first '
* use dt, to delete up to the comma
* move to the space with l or <rightarrow>
* paste with p
* move right to the first number
* use dt) to delete up to the )
* use F( to move back to the (
* paste with p
* use /zonk<return> to find another zonk but not modify it in case it's not correct
* press q to stop recording
* play back the macro with @q and then @@ (play last macro)

That looks complicated, but your fingers will Just Do It!

I think Sublime Text also does nice things similar to this.

















BTW NERDTree
------------

Hey Steve press F6


















Downsides
---------

* Autocomplete is not the greatest sometimes
* Learning curve, derp
* Configuration has an even steeper (though not awful) learning curve














Good Plug-Ins
=============

* Pathogen
* NERDTree
* surround
