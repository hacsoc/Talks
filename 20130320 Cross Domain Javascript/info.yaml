  Letsgift.it is trying to deliver a new way to do group gifts, and they are
  looking for a few Case hackers to bring on as interns this summer (as I mentioned
  a few weeks ago.)  If you would like to learn more, come and chat with Marco and,
  hopefully, Ryan O'Donnell, the two co-founders.

  Remember to stop by tonight's Hacker Society talk, where Marco, LetsGift.it's
  CTO, will be talking about getting around the Same Origin Policy in JavaScript
  using the EasyXDM library.  Specifically, he will use the video recorder
  LetsGift.it built as an example of some of the cool stuff you can do.
