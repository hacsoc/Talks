  Quick discussion on what courses are worth taking and when is the best time
  to take them. Super helpful for underclassmen, and we'd appreciate any
  comments during the talk from older and wiser upperclassmen. After that,
  Aaron Neyer and Diego Waxemberg are then going to give a presentation and
  demo of Moonlight (moonlight-stream.com), one of the coolest student projects
  to come out of CWRU.
