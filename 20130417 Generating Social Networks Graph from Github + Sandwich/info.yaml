  My talk will just be a brief presentation of my work with Aron Lindberg in
  generating social network graphs from Github. I will talk about some of the
  technologies used, such as Googles BigQuery for getting large amounts of data
  with minimal effort.
  <br />
  My talk will be relatively short, and afterwards me, Brendan, Diego, and
  Cameron will give a mini talk on the current progress of Sandwich.
