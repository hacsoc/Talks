  This week we have a company coming to talk to us. Epic is giving a "mystery" talk Wednesday night at 7:30 in the Glennan glass room.

  Epic is a software company at the intersection of two dynamic fields: medicine
  and computer science. As a developer at Epic, you’ll directly impact the way
  1 in 3 Americans receives healthcare – in fact, there’s a good chance your
  innovations will affect the life of someone close to you. You’ll push the boundaries
  in creating software to reduce medical errors, improve screening for diseases,
  and improve the quality of patient care. The software you’ll develop will be
  used by some of the world’s largest healthcare organizations and leading
  research institutions, including Kaiser Permanente, Cleveland Clinic, Stanford, and Yale.
