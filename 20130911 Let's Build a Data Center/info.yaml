  Join Yelp Software Engineers as they dig in to current projects and describe
  what it's like to work as an engineer at Yelp HQ in San Francisco. Meet our
  engineering team and ask us questions about our open stack programming languages,
  daily push cycle, and open-source projects. We will be providing dinner and
  raffling off an iPad mini, so remember to bring your CS or engineering resume
  to get a raffle ticket!

  I'm hoping to cover a variety of topics about building and supporting a large
  internet property from the low level hardware all the way up to the high level
  software. My goal is to provide some insight into both the day-to-day operation
  and the higher-level architecture that goes into building and scaling redundant,
  highly-available, and performant systems.
