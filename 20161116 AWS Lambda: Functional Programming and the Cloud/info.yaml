  In 2014, AWS Lambda took the internet by storm when it was released to be a 
  "serverless", event driven computing platform. Dina will be giving an awesome 
  talk on the premise of AWS Lambda, functional programming and why you should 
  start using it in your personal projects. It will be a simple glimpse into a 
  relatively new platform. Dina will also be doing some pretty cool live demos 
  that require audience participation as well! For some of us, time to crack 
  out our PLC knowledge or if you are new to functional programming come to 
  learn more about it! Hope everyone can make it
