  What's a hackathon? Why should I go? What if I have no experience? And the
  most important question: How do I sign up? These and a million other
  hackathon questions will be answered on Wednesday night. Following a 5 minute
  lightning talk on hackathons, you can hang out for the rest of the hour to do
  nothing but check out the demos of MHacks projects that were built by our
  Hacker Society students this weekend.
