  Come get advice on advising from upperclassmen who have read graduation
  requirements, are up-to-date on recent changes, and have already taken the
  classes you're considering. We've been researching all semester and working
  with both the department and Undergraduate Studies to improve the current way
  that information is dispersed. If you're interested in exploring or learning
  more about  a particular area of computing, we'll have upperclassmen on hand
  to give you advice. Go in to your advising meetings with your professors
  well-prepared and confident in your lineup. We will be prepared for all EECS
  majors.
