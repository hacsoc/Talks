   I will be talking about Linear Hashing, a common file-structure that databases
   and file systems use to index data. If you have ever wondered how to implement
   a hash table that grows beyond the size of the main memory on your computer
   this is the talk for you! I will discuss the algorithm and its properties.
   A Go implementation will be provided for your enjoyment.
