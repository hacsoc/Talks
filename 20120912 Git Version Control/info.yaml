  This week John Gunderman will fearlessly be giving a talk on Version Control
  with Git.  What it is, how to use it (properly), and how it works are all things
  that absolutely every good professional programmer should know, whether they
  are from Case or not!  Luckily for you, the presentation John will give while
  juggling bowling pins on a unicycle* will help you get started with all of that!
