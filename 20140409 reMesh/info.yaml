  Beginning with "We the People" the US Constitution implies that it itself speaks
  for the newly forming American people. In the United States the idea of
  "speaking for the people" is central to governance and implemented by way of a
  representative democracy.  People are elected to 'speak for' their constituents
  within different governing bodies. This idea is predicated upon the assumption
  that the people will elect the individual which best 'speaks for' them.  This
  paradigm has a few fundamental challenges: First, the options of who can be chosen
  to 'speak for' a group are typically limited.  Second, the ways by which a
  ‘speaker’ can be chosen are overly simplistic  and subject to many forms of
  corruption.  Lastly, a single person may be subject to many influences outside
  of the group they speak for.  The resulting 'voice' is an unreliable and crude
  approximation to what it means to 'speak for' a group of people.  

  This talk will introduce a theoretical framework to more objectively consider
  what it means to 'speak for' a group of people as well as discuss its
  computational implementation within the context of a conversation.
