  Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) have a variety of applications in writing,
  verifying and documenting logic design. In particular, they are used designing
  logic used in a number of real-time or embedded environments, such as for PLDs,
  FPGAs or logic ASICS. I will be providing a very brief introduction to the Verilog
  HDL, and demonstrating how to use standard synthesize-able Verilog language constructs
  to write practical logic designs. I will also go through a few examples to give
  further context.
