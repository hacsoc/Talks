  Functions about functions. For the first half an hour we will learn how to use
  functions about functions. Examples will be mostly in Python since many already
  know the language. The next half an hour will discuss implementation details
  from the compiler author's perspective. If your a beginner come learn a neat
  programming construct you may not have used. If you already know everything
  about use higher order functions come learn how they work under the covers.
