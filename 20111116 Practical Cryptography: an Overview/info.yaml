  The advent of public-key cryptography in the 1970s, together with the rise of
  computers, caused a revolution in the field of secret keeping.  Cryptography
  was quickly changed from an esoteric art to a public science.  It became
  accessible to the masses as never before, spurring a revolution in the field
  as it adapted to handling the everyday business of a much larger audience.
  After giving a very brief introduction on the need for and workings of public-key
  algorithms, I will discuss many of the difficulties inherent in using these and
  other cryptographic primitives to secure information in the real world.
  We shall touch on topics criminally under-discussed today, including the PKI
  problem, secure storage of passwords, and the issues associated with storing data in-place.
