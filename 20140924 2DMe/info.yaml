  Dave Fleischer is a lifelong animator/developer, with a background creating
  "bleeding edge" real-time technology for animation production, at places
  like Wildbrain and Gravity in San Francisco -- and as Nickelodeon's external
  R&D department in NY.  From 2003 - 2008 he grew and coordinated The
  Cleveland Institute of Art's animation program.  His current company "2Dme"
  is creating a simple lightweight technology that will take a picture of your
  face and automatically create a 2D avatar you can talk with.

  The advantage: Unlike 3d --- you won't be "creeped out by your avatar.  And
  unlike the massive demands for video transmission -- each moment in 2Dme's
  data transmission can function even if the bandwidth is as low as 2K. (So
  face to face in a bandwidth similar to that of texting!) We'll present
  pieces of our technology -- along with some of the issues related to making
  avatars that people don't find...um... creepy.
