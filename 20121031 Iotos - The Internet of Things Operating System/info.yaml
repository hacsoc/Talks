  1. Open-source projects and tools for creating your own internet-enabled projects
  <br />
  This will be a whirl-wind tour of a number of open-source projects and tools
  that we have found useful including:
  <br />
  Arduino, Roving Networks Wifly modules, the Apache Mina project, Amazon AWS
  and EC2, Ubuntu Server, and a light topping of PHP. The talk will be more tutorial
  oriented showing how you can leverage each of these tools in your own projects.
  <br />
  2. The iOTOS platform, what it does, and how to use it
  I definitely don't want this to be a sales pitch...so this will be relatively
  brief. We'll cover the iOTOS platform, what it does, how it works, and how you
  can use it in your own internet-enabled projects.
