                            <p><strong>Description: </strong>I will talk about how to pull relevant information off of web pages using tools such as Nokogiri and Mechanize, and some tips for how to best analyze the source code to most efficiently extract the information. I will also go over how search engines like Google create web crawlers that scrape information off of web pages to create an index of the internet.

After college Brandon worked at Preemptive Solutions where he worked on C# obfuscation and app analytics product. In 2012 he relocated to sunnier San Francisco where he worked as a web developer at Causes. Now at Mobile Defense Brandon has worked on a variety of things including: Ruby web development, Windows Phone applications, Android application, and Python and Scala back end services. Most recently he has worked as on our deployment and provisioning infrastructure which uses Capistrano and Chef. <br /> His talk will offer a brief intro to monads and side effect free code as well as an introduction to the observable monad. Brandon will also offer an example of how reactive programming can benefit UI design.

This week's HacSoc talk is about cryptography: the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties. This talk will be a little different than the usual talks in that it does not require knowledge of any specific technology, but it is still technical in nature.  <br /> I'll give a background of the technology used to keep messages safe and focus on how it has evolved over time. This talk is designed to engage beginners and cryptography experts alike, so come to Hacker Society this Wednesday to explore cryptography's...

I strongly recommend that both of the speakers keep me happy tomorrow. Honestly, both talks should be pretty interesting, and appeal to a wide range of people.

We will discuss the history of rigorous measurement and the general approaches taken to date.  We argue that the approaches taken to date---while useful in modest terms---lack the broad visibility required to understand the Internet at scale.  We then introduce a Firefox extension---called Fathom---that will provides a measurement-oriented API to JavaScript code that can be included with any web page and hence executed on a broad set of Internet-connected hosts.  We discuss several use cases for this extensions, discuss security and privacy implications, sketch the overhead of the system and the accuracy of the measurements.

I will explore the more curious and unique design features of Plan 9, the reasons for them, and the fact that the circles of Hell dynamically link to one another.

                            <p><strong>Description: </strong>The advent of public-key cryptography in the 1970s, together with the rise of computers, caused a revolution in the field of secret keeping.  Cryptography was quickly changed from an esoteric art to a public science.  It became accessible to the masses as never before, spurring a revolution in the field as it adapted to handling the everyday business of a much larger audience. After giving a very brief introduction on the need for and workings of public-key algorithms, I will discuss many of the difficulties inherent in using these and other cryptographic primitives to secure information in the real world. We shall touch on topics criminally under-discussed today, including the PKI problem, secure storage of passwords, and the issues associated with storing data in-place.

                            <p><strong>Description: </strong>There is a fundamental difficulty that comes up when you try to parallelize a task: would you like your architecture to employ shared or distributed memory? For example, if you use shared memory, how do you let a specific processor know whether or not a piece of data was updated by another processor. A proposed solution comes by passing messages using a library called MPI, Message Passing Interface. MPI uses graph theory to understand the architecture and efficiently pass messages between vertices/processors. Unfortunately, MPI doesn't simply compile a parallized version of your program and, if you want a parallel algorithm, you have to be aware of bits of your algorithm that are readily parallelizable. One readily parallelizable component is the iteration space of some loop: I will give examples of matrix vector multiplication and two efficient ways to parallelize the iteration space in a finding prime numbers algorithm. <br /> As an added treat, we can easily learn how to initialize workers in Matlab's Parallel Computing Toolbox (Parallel Toolbox is included with Case's version of Matlab) and how to perform for-loops in parallel under certain conditions (Matlab parallelization pays off in time even on 2-core computers).

Furthermore, many of the analysis tools are expensive, confusing, or are simply never taught. My talk will both introduce the concept of TEMPEST as well as more broadly describe signals intelligence attacks, counterattacks, and counter-countermeasures, as well as an overview of time vs. frequency domain analysis, vulnerability of devices, and a variety of demonstrations exposing these concepts (and a couple of campus radio signals to boot). Topics covered will include: <br /> -So what's a spectrum analyzer, anyways? <br /> -Why are all* receivers transmitters? <br /> -What do power supplies have to do with device security? <br /> -What kinds of radio protocols are out there? <br /> -What kinds of equipment can be used to toy around with these concepts? <br /> ...as well as a variety of other concepts.
