Schematic capture: understanding how the parts connect, expressing. Electrical requirements/values. Layout: footprint design, number of layers on board, routing signals, ground/power planes, design rules/constraints, placement of components Manufacturing options for prototypes. Software options and standards for this process. Board hand assembly: surface mount and through-hole. Demonstrations of gEDA and the resulting product.

This week's HacSoc talk is about cryptography: the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties. This talk will be a little different than the usual talks in that it does not require knowledge of any specific technology, but it is still technical in nature.  <br /> I'll give a background of the technology used to keep messages safe and focus on how it has evolved over time. This talk is designed to engage beginners and cryptography experts alike, so come to Hacker Society this Wednesday to explore cryptography's...

Meet our engineering team and ask us questions about our open stack programming languages, daily push cycle, and open-source projects.

My goal is to provide some insight into both the day-to-day operation and the higher-level architecture that goes into building and scaling redundant, highly-available, and performant systems.
