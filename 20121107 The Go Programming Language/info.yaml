  Go is a programming language that went into development by a team at Google in 2007,
  including Rob Pike, Ken Thompson, and Robert Griesemer.  One of the stated goals

  of programming of a dynamically typed, and I know that it is being used more
  and more internally at Google. Brendan will be offering an introduction of the
  features and design choices in the language and their motivation.
